# Heap-assignment

Manage Heap

Implemented heap management algorithms such as best fit, worst fit, next fit, and first fit.
Implemeted splitting and coalescing to manage free blocks.
Implemented realloc and calloc

Prerequisites

You will need to have virtual machine installed on your computer
VM is recommended to run this project

Installation

git clone https://github.com/bevanphilip/Heap

To Run

cd HeapAssignment

make

env LD_PRELOAD=lib/libmalloc-ff.so tests/test (override existing malloc by LD_PRELOAD)

To run first-fit and next-fit replace libmalloc-ff.so with

env LD_PRELOAD=lib/libmalloc-ff.so tests/ffnf
First-Fit: libmalloc-ff.so
Next-Fit: libmalloc-nf.so

To run best-fit and worst-fit replace libmalloc-ff.so with

env LD_PRELOAD=lib/libmalloc-ff.so tests/bfwf
Best-Fit: libmalloc-bf.so
worst-Fit: libmalloc-wf.so

To run other test cases replace test1 with

env LD_PRELOAD=lib/libmalloc-bf.so tests/test1
To test malloc and free: tests/test1
To test malloc and free: tests/test2
To test coalesce: tests/test3
To test split and reuse: tests/test4
